## What is hugo ?
![hugo logo](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c38c7334cc3f23585738e40334284fddcaf03d5e/2e17c/images/hugo-logo-wide.svg)
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a popular open source static site generator written in Go.  
It basically convert markdown into a nice HTML page (like the one that you are reading).  
It is very useful to simple usage like writting a blog or a documentation. 
Since Hugo does not requires to be a HTML/CSS/JS ninja for a basic usage pretty much anyone can use it and is a nice alternative to more complex solutions like wordpress or plume which will need to have a SQL storage. It is also worthy to note that 
Hugo is very well documented.
